The biggest parties of germany, SPD and CDU/CSU, have lost nearly half of there members since 1990. Many political parties, according to Van Biezen, lost there ability to include the public society. Only a quarter of all german citizens still trust political parties. Pursuent to the articles of Welch <sup class="reference">[Welch05]</sup> and <sup class="reference">[Welch03]</sup> there is a direkt relationship between satisfaction, trust and transparency. The connected net creates new possibilities to raise transparency and interaction between politicians and civil society with participatory online platforms.</p><p>The goal of this thesis is to increase the transparency&nbsp;of political decision-making and thus trust in political parties. In order to reach this goal I imagine a participatory online platform where politicans, officials and citizens can interact directly within a flat hierarchy. It is therefore a task to develop a concept for a platform which enables to build a well formed online community for interaction within the context of politics. It has to be examined which generall aspects of community building have to be considered. Furthermore existing mechanisms and pitfalls have to be identified by analysing existing platforms.</p><p>After concretizing the concept a prototype will be developed and mechanics anaylized with a survey.</p></section><section><h1>Building a successfull online community</h1><p>According to Robert Krauts (et al.) book&nbsp;<sup class="reference">[10.2307/j.ctt5hhgvw]</sup> there are four key aspects for building successful online communities: attracting newcomers, encouraging commitment, encouraging contributions and regulating behavior. All these aspects, descibed in detail below, and the resulting design choices for the proposed software follow in this chapter.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;">Attracting newcomers</span><br>Newcomers play an important role to the community. They restock leaving members or contribute in growth. On the other hand they have to accustom to the norms of the group and&nbsp;while doing so may be antagonizing long-established members. The book focusses on the experiences of newcomers and the experiences of current members, durring the evolvement from "reader-to-leader" <sup class="reference">[Preece09]</sup>. For newcomers it is important to keep the entry barrier low but still introduce them via initiation rituals and welcoming practices.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;">Encouraging commitment</span><br>Based on the work of Kurt Lewin regarding "field theory," where commitment is a building block for a community which relates to the properties of the environment (field) Kraut and his coauthors identify three kinds of commitment to communities:</p><ul><li><em>affective commitment</em>, "based on feelings of closeness and attachment to a group or members of the group"</li><li><em>normative commitment</em>, "based on feelings of rightness or obligations to the group</li><li><em>need-based or continuance commitment</em>, "based on an incentive structure in the group and alternatives available to members from outside that increase the net costs of leaving the group."</li></ul><p>Furthermore they differentiate between identity-based and bonds-based commitment which can be traced back to Festinger, Schachter, and Back’s (1950) theory of group cohesiveness, where they define the two types as commitment through attractiveness of the group or through the attractiveness of individual group members. In the former members link themselves to certain characteristics of the community (e.x. main topic of the community) or to other members and the interaction with them.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;">Encouraging contributions</span><br>Contribution is the heart of each community. Kraut and Resnick therefore explored methods for encouraging and maximizing contribution amongst others linked to theories of motivation in social psychnology. As successful examples for contribution Kraut and Resnick list the open source software community Apache, the&nbsp;Internet encyclopedia Wikipedia. But it is also outlined that volunteers often leave tasks undone they find unappealing. That's why companies often have paid employees which handle neccesary tasks. They mention classic Expectancy-Value models (V. Vroom, Porter, &amp; Lawler, 2005) where motivation is a multiplicative function of expectancy and value with a two-stage process where individual effort has some impact on performance (e.x. completed features of a software product), and performance has some impact on outcomes (e.x. acknowledgement of community). The satisfaction resulting from outcome can lay in intrinsic and extrinsiv motivation (Burke &amp; Kraut, 2008). The further discussion of the social psychology of "collective effort" is rooted in a 1993 review paper by Karau and Williams's work on social loafing and their attempts to understand and promote individuals to make substantive contributions when in groups rather than depend on the efforts of others. The overall emphasis of the chapter is on motivating individuals to make the maximum meaningful contribution they can, motivated through clever software design, task structures, and reward architectures</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;">Regulating behavior</span><br>Online communities can have differing norms in order to "help the community achieve its mission". Furthermore norms should reach rough concensus to ensure that members enforce the adherence of these. The authors of this chapter (Kiesler, Kraut, Resnick, and Kittur) differ between community insiders and outsiders like "trolls" and "manipulators" who "have no vested interest in the community functioning well." The main design claims in this chapter focus on:</p><ul><li><strong>limiting effects of bad behavior</strong> through moderation systems, making "inappropriate posts" less prominent, keeping consisten moderation policies, including community members in moderation, offering reversion tools, and introducing filters.</li><li><strong>limiting bad behavior itself</strong>, through activity quotas (to prevent spam), suspensions and bans, consistent criteria for suspensions with due process, payment requirements that raise the cost of activity, and CAPTCHAs</li><li><strong>encouraging voluntary compliance</strong>, by ensuring that people learn the norms, showing examples of appropriate or inappropriate behavior (but not too much) <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="http://acawiki.org/Building_successful_online_communities:_Evidence-based_social_design#cite_note-23" data-mce-href="http://acawiki.org/Building_successful_online_communities:_Evidence-based_social_design#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="http://acawiki.org/Building_successful_online_communities:_Evidence-based_social_design#cite_note-24" data-mce-href="http://acawiki.org/Building_successful_online_communities:_Evidence-based_social_design#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>, displaying statistics on normative behavior, and reminding people about norms at the point of action. They also discuss the possibility of these interventions backfiring.</li></ul><p>The authors further argue that norms are stronger if it is possible for the community to adhere to norms and rules. Sometimes members have to act against the norms so it is helpfull to redirect misbehaviour to an outside space where "not a bunch of people are ‘watching’ the flame". They also present a system called stopit developed by MIT where reported users accuesed of harrasement get a message from the system pretending that the harassers account got comprimised and that the user should change its password in order to stop harrasement. Pursuent to Gregory Jackson, the Director of Academic Computing at MIT this stoped harrasement effectively without accusing users directly, helping the to keep their face.</p><p>The last section of this chapter concludes about sanctions and rewards. Sanctions in an pseudonym based community are less affective as it is possible to members switch pseudonyms. The authors depict mechanisms to make sanctions more consequential, such as reputation systems, "attention bonds" that "make undesirable actions more costly," costs associated with pseudonym switching, "bonds that may be forfeited if the newcomers misbehave," membership referral systems that affect the reputation of a sponsoring member.&nbsp;</p></section><section><h1>Concepts for a political platform</h1><p>##TODO Explain why you decided to opt for an Question-And-Answer Platform (QA): Draft:<br>I first thought that it would be possible to use a localised platform like politics.stackexchange.com but then realised that politics is not only about information and solutions but also compromise and agreement. StackExchange sites focus on one interest: giving the best possible answer of course it can be opinion based but there is only one interest. In politics you have users with differering interests which makes it much harder to design a simple process to meet the interests of a maximised number of users.##<br><br>In this chapter I'm going to state all the design decision to build a successfull QA platform. The chapter is structured by the chapters of the book&nbsp;<sup class="reference">[10.2307/j.ctt5hhgvw]</sup>.

Do you know any friends which could enjoy being part of our community? -&gt; Forward")).<br>It shall also be possible to forward and share a current question, answer, selected comment via link or social networks {3,4}.<br>Send once in a while personal emails to most influencing users of the community to encourage them to recruit others in their social networks {5}.<br>Ask users for testimonials which will be reviewed and potentially&nbsp;prominetely shown on the homepage (with notification to user who gave testimonial that his comment was published) {7,8}.<br></p><div data-mce-style="float: right; width: 300px;" style="float: right; width: 300px;" class="remark">Which information should be shown on homepage?

It won't help against trolls but against people who have no vetted interest in participating in the community. Not logged in users will be illustrated on the homepage of the platform how the community should function, which features to expect, the goals and norms to keep in mind {11}. To keep the entry barrier (registering) low, the potential member can directly choose on the homepage groups of special interest. After choosing (1-x???) question(s) will be shown to him where he is asked if the question, answers, comments are high quality. He will be asked if he can give substantial feedback or even give an own answer {13}. After this he will be asked if he would like to join the community to make his changes permanent (otherwise they will be saved somewhere for later use (for some time)). If he registered the changes will be looked over by an moderator / or choosen user with special rights (see&nbsp;Design Claim 4 in chapter "Regulating Behavior in online communities") for compliance to the community norms {12}. As newcomers are possibly not familiar with established rules and norms the first three??? questions after sign up can be assigned to a member of the mentoring program {18,23,24} (is every member automaticaly part of the mentoring program???) to revise the question if necessary and circumvent bad feelings if the question does not fit into the community or is elsewhere disadvantageous {13}. ##TODO Include study to online hate.

With this voting mechanism the community builds a collective opinion of helpfull and non-helpfull content. Further it is possible to comment each question or answer, for example to raise new questions in the context of the given question / answer or to propose improvements. If a discussion is needed it is possible to use a chat room but stackexchange.com discourages the use of it as stated by one of the founders on <sub class="footnote"><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/civilized-discourse-construction-kit/" data-mce-href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/civilized-discourse-construction-kit/">https://blog.codinghorror.com/civilized-discourse-construction-kit/</a></sub>:</p><blockquote>At Stack Exchange, one of the tricky things we learned about Q&amp;A is that if your goal is to have an excellent signal to noise ratio, <strong>you <em>must</em> suppress discussion.</strong> Stack Exchange only supports the absolute minimum amount of discussion necessary to produce great questions and great answers. That's why answers get constantly re-ordered by votes, that's why comments have limited formatting and length and only a few display, and so forth. Almost every design decision we made was informed by our desire to push discussion down, to inhibit it in every way we could.
